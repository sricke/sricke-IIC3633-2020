## Summary
In the blog, the author presented a recommendation system for the Netflix prize.They presented a solution based in SVD approximation, where a rating is calculated as a normalized sum over a given set of features between the multiplication of the preference that the user gives to that feature and to the degree that that movie exemplifies that feature. To do this, the training consists in the iteration over all features and movies trying to lower the error (given rating and predicted rating) adjusted to a learning rate. The author also proposes an initialization technique for a new feature based on the average rating of the movie and an offset of the user, adjusted to a global average in the case of movies with less ratings. Finally, it also proposes regularization techniques and nonlinear functions to adjust the predicted ratings.
## Proposals
I find the proposed techniques to be interesting though I have two main comments to propose some improvements. First of all, the model has a high number of hyperparameters, the nonlinear function to use, level of regularization adjustment, learning rate, number of features and the parameter of the initialization (K). The results of training could vary a lot between different hyperparameters and a better iteration through different hyperparameters could maybe improve the results. Second, I find that during training since you iterate over all features only once (but a number of times over that same feature) the approximation of rating gets better in the last features but the first ones probably not (because it's lacking more information) so additional iterations are needed through features to improve the performance of the first ones.
